# GTICompat
A minecraft 1.12.2 mod provide capability IC2 GTCEu energy
# GTCEu accept energy from:
    -transformers
    -single block generators
    -nuclear reactor and reactor chambers
    -reailcraft unloader
# GTCEu NOT accept energy from:
    -kinetic generator (only with IC2 transformer)
    -any IC2 cable
# IC2 mechanism works:
    -basic electric mechanism
    -cropharvester
    -cropmatron
    -RailCraft energy loader
# IC2 items works:
    -IC2 item charge
# Energy:
    -when energy recieve from ic2 amps and voltage WORKS, be careful energy source tier is work!
# Not work:
    -when energy recieve from GTCEu voltage not works (no explosion).
    -some mechanism from IC2 not recieve GTCEu energy
    -kinetic generator directly (only with IC2 transformers)
